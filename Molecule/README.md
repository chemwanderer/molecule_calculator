- [matrix](https://github.com/chemwanderer/molecule_calculator/blob/main/Molecule/matrix.h) appeared as a kind of personal training ground for learning C++. It includes 'matrix' class and the implementation of some linear algebra procedures, such as various methods for eigenvalues and eigenvectors evaluation, as well as methods for solving generalized symmetrical eigenvalue problem **HC = SCe**. It also includes procedures for finding saddle points of multidimensional surfaces. Here, matrix.h is an auxiliary file.
- [molecule](https://github.com/chemwanderer/molecule_calculator/blob/main/Molecule/molecule.h) implements a range of procedures related to the quantum mechanics of molecular systems, including restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock electronic energy evaluation, molecular system geometry optimization, determination of the structure of the transition state and its relaxation into 'reagents' and 'products' (although I do understand that HF is not really suitable in this case; anyway, it was interesting to test the algorithm itself).
